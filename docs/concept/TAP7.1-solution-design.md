# 1 Business Case

## 1.1 Executive Summary

The "Hausanschluss" Bundle aims to simplify the installation of the enablement services Eclipse Dataspace
Connector (EDC), Digital Twin Registry (DTR), and their supporting components. By developing a flexible, parameterizable
installation package, the project seeks to reduce deployment complexity and lower barriers to participation in the
Catena‑X data space. This bundle will enable independent component updates and support a modular "bring your own"
approach, ultimately fostering a more efficient and accessible ecosystem for diverse participants—such as testers,
external product developers, product testers, and small and medium-sized enterprises.

## 1.2 Business Need

Current deployment methods for data space integration are complex and require significant manual effort. This PoC
addresses the need to:

- **Reduce Complexity:** Simplify the deployment topology by bundling components into capabilities.
- **Automate Deployment:** Provide an automated installation package using Kubernetes and HELM.
- **Minimize Configuration Overhead:** Streamline the integration process by providing pre-configured bundles that require only minimal manual parameter adjustments.
- **Extend Documentation:** Provide a detailed documentation tailored to the target groups.
- **Enable Extension:** Design the system to allow the seamless addition of new components or capabilities.

## 1.3 Objectives

- **Simplify Deployment and Maintenance:** Develop an installation package that minimizes manual configuration through
  automation.
- **Ensure Modularity:** Structure the bundle so that components can be independently installed, updated, or replaced
  without affecting other services.
- **Facilitate Flexibility:** Implement a "bring your own" model for key components, such as EDC, PostgreSQL, and HashiCorp
  Vault, to allow tailored deployments that meet specific needs.
- **Increase Accessibility**: Lower entry barriers for new participants by reducing technical complexity and operational
  dependencies.
- **Scalability:** Structure the bundles so that they can be deployed multiple times.

## 1.4 Expected Deliverables

- **PoC Documentation:** A concept and architecture overview highlighting the modular design.
- **Modular Installation Package:** A set of HELM charts for deploying the enablement service bundles:
    - **Dataspace Connector:** Including the Eclipse Dataspace Connector, EDC PostgreSQL, and HashiCorp Vault.
    - **Digital Twin Bundle:** Featuring components such as the Decentral DT Registry (with “bring your own” PostgreSQL)
    - **Data Persistence Layer Bundle:** Including a simple Submodel Server to store semantic data.
    - **Identity Wallet Bundle:** Covering the Identity Wallet functionality.
- **Demonstration Environment:** A test deployment showcasing reduced complexity and improved efficiency.
- **Basic User Guide:** Instructions on how to deploy and update the PoC bundle.

## 1.5 Benefits

- **Operational Efficiency:** Faster and more reliable deployments with less manual work.
- **Scalability:** A modular design that can be scaled or adapted for future full-scale deployments.
- **Ease of Adoption:** Simplified deployment processes make it easier for testers and external developers to engage.

## 1.6. Dependencies

- **Interoperability** with the CATENA‑X standards.

## 1.7. Success Criteria

- **Technology Readiness Level:** Achievement of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3, as specified in the requirements.
- **Functional PoC Deployment:** Demonstrated automated, modular installation with reduced manual steps.
- **Simplified Configuration:** Clear evidence of reduced configuration complexity.
- **Positive Feedback:** End-user validation from a select group of demo participants and the Tractus-X community.
- **Documentation Completeness:** Availability of concise deployment and user guides.

## 1.8. Out of Scope

- **Full Production Readiness:** This PoC is not intended to be a production-ready solution.
- **Core Services Exclusion:** Core services are not part of the Hausanschluss Bundles.
- **App Provider Role:** The role of App Provider is considered out of scope for this deployment.
- **Alternative Deployment Techniques:** While the evaluation of alternative deployment methods is acknowledged, the primary
  focus remains on Kubernetes and HELM-based deployment.

# 4 TO-BE Design

## 4.1 People

### 4.1.1 Target Group Analysis

Overall data space roles:
- [Collaboration & Roles](https://catena-x.net/ecosystem/collaboration-roles/)
- [Who: Roles in the Catena-X ecosystem](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/operating-model/who-roles-in-the-catena-x-ecosystem)

The relevant data space roles are:

- Data Consumer
- Data Provider
- Enablement Service Provider

Scope: Umbrella HELM Charts

- Enablement Services: These services are included under the umbrella of HELM charts, focusing on enabling
  functionalities.

Out of Scope: Core services such as Portal or BPDM are not considered within this scope.

Primary target groups:

| No. | Target group                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Data space roles                                                    | Target group differentiation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Behaviour, Needs, Pains & Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### 4.2.2 Business Process (SCC Artifact)

#### Chart Release Process

Charts will be released using the already existing workflow in the Umbrella Chart repository. The workflow will
automatically release a Chart, once it is pushed to the "charts/" directory with a new Chart version.

Chart versions should follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)

#### Capability Bundle Structure

Capability bundle modularization for the Tractus-X Umbrella Helm chart is a sound architectural and operational design.
It aligns with both the domain-driven architecture of Catena-X (data exchange, digital twin, identity, semantics are
distinct domains) and with Kubernetes best practices for managing complex applications (using an umbrella chart to
bundle related microservices).

Each bundle is self-sufficient, which improves isolation (failures or changes in one domain have minimal impact on
others) and allows scaling and upgrading along domain lines. It simplifies deployment by allowing “plug-and-play”
capabilities: an Enablement Service Provider can decide which bundles to operate based on its role e.g., include the
Digital Twin and Semantic bundles if offering an asset-rich service, or omit them if not. The approach is consistent
with how other OSS projects deliver multi-component systems, providing one-step installation without sacrificing the
ability to tweak individual parts.

Why this structure was proposed:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**  
   Each capability bundle (e.g. EDC Data Transfer, Digital Twin, Identity & Trust, Semantic Model) aligns with a
   specific functional domain. This separation makes it easier to understand the role of each service (e.g., the EDC
   connector vs. the digital twin registry), reduces coupling between unrelated components, and ultimately makes
   maintenance and troubleshooting more straightforward.
2. **Modular Deployment**  
   Some participants in Catena-X may not need all services (e.g., some might not use the Digital Twin bundle). By
   structuring the umbrella chart into bundles, a user can enable just those needed capabilities. This leads to leaner
   installs and avoids unnecessary resource usage.
3. **Best Practices with Helm**  
   Using an umbrella chart with subcharts/bundles is a well-recognized Helm best practice for complex applications. It
   allows a single helm install to set up multiple microservices while still allowing each service to have its own
   lifecycle, configuration, and version.
4. **Alignment with Domain-Driven Approach**  
   Catena-X is organized around distinct, loosely-coupled “building blocks.” Bundling services by domain matches this
   architectural vision. It’s clear which domain each set of microservices belongs to (EDC for data exchange, identity
   for credential management, etc.). This clarity also helps new adopters navigate the ecosystem.

#### Deployment strategies

##### Role: Data Provider

The standard data provider role consists of an EDC, DTR and Submodel Server Bundles. EDC uses the Identity Wallet Bundle.

    E --> B
    E --> C

##### Role: Data Consumer

The standard data consumer role consists of only the EDC Bundle and the Identity Wallet Bundle.

    C --> B

    D --> C
````

##### Role: Enablement Provider

The Enablement Provider role consists of both the Data Consumer and Data Provider bundles. This allows provisioning of
data and the consumption of the provisioned data by a application.

````

#### Bring your own

Each Bundle can be deactivated to use your own component. This requires configuration of the component specific
parameters in the other components.

In this example this would be the configuration of the Identity Wallet within the EDC.

````mermaid
flowchart BT
    A("Application to be tested/developed")
    style A fill:#afafaf,color:black
    B["Capability Bundle: Dataspace Connector"]
    C["<s>Capability Bundle: Identity & Trust</s>"]
    D["Own Identity Wallet"]
    E{{"Developer/Tester"}}
    A --> B
    B -- identitywallet - bundle . enabled = false --> C
    B -- configure --> D
    E --> A
````

Using a "bring-your-own" component requires additional configuration. In this case, the identity wallet has to be configured in the EDC configuration section.

Replacing existing Charts with your own solution is not limited to the direct components of the Capability Bundles.  
This also applies to the dependencies of the bundles which e.g. allows the user to choose another way of provisioning a database.

Components which can be replaced are:

- Capability Bundle: Dataspace Connector
    - postgresql
    - vault
- Capability Bundle: Digital Twin
    - postgresql
    - keycloak
- Capability Bundle: Identity & Trust
    - ssi-dim-wallet-stub
- Capability Bundle: Data Persistence Layer
    - simple-data-backend

To make configuration of "bring-your-own" components easier, the bundle config has to highlight which values are 
related to which dependency and what to change, if the components should be replaced:

```yaml
digital-twin-registry:
  registry:
    dataSource:
      # replace this when using your own database
      # url: 
      # user: 
      # password: 
```

#### Scalability

It is essential that the deployment of each bundle is entirely independent, allowing the same bundle to be deployed multiple times.
Every instance must maintain its own unique set of Kubernetes resources, ensuring there is no overlap or shared dependencies between different deployments.

#### Interoperability

To ensure interoperability, the [Tractus-X Release Guidelines](https://eclipse-tractusx.github.io/docs/release/) are followed and [Catena-X standards](https://catenax-ev.github.io/docs/standards/overview) are understood and applied.  
Additionally, the existing functionality of the Umbrella Chart must be kept and verified to work.

### 4.2.2.1 Reduction of Complexity in the Deployment Process

#### 1. Standardization of Bundle Configuration

Goal: Make "Bring-Your-Own" components easier to configure
Each chart should provide clear default values for all optional components (e.g. postgresql.enabled=false, external.postgresql.url=...).

Clearly mark all BYO-related config sections in values.yaml, like:

```yaml
# === Bring Your Own ===
postgresql:
  enabled: false
  external:
    host: my-own-db
    port: 5432
````
Out of scope: Use central _helpers.tpl functions to standardize naming conventions across all charts. (technical feasability needs to be evaluated)


#### 2. Automated Validation & Linting in CI

Goal: Increase robustness & transparency

Extend umbrella chart workflow with:
* helm lint on subcharts and umbrella chart
* helm template + kubeval for static validation
* tests with both minimal and BYO configurations

Example (GitHub Action or GitLab CI): yaml

```
script:
  - helm lint charts/*
  - helm template charts/my-bundle | kubeval
````
#### 3. CLI or Script Support for Custom Deployments

Goal: Improve usability & reduce user error

Create a simple CLI tool (e.g., Bash, Python, Go) that:
* Loads environment variables
* Generates values.yaml files from templates
* Triggers the Helm deployment

**Warning:** technical feasability needs to be evaluated

#### 4. Dynamic Naming for Multiple Deployments

Goal: Enable scalability

Use a deploymentName prefix in templates: yaml

```
name: {{ .Values.deploymentName }}-edc
````

This allows deploying multiple instances of the same bundle in one cluster: bash

```
helm install edc-a . --set deploymentName=edc-a
helm install edc-b . --set deploymentName=edc-b
````

**Warning:** technical feasability needs to be evaluated

#### 5. Documentation & Visibility

Goal: Transparency for users

Structured README per bundle:
* What is optional?
* What must be configured?
* How to replace a component with BYO?
* Include tables listing supported overrides (Markdown or auto-generated)
