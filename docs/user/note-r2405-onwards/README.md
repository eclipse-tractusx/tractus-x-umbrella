# Note from R24.05 onwards

:warning: The 24.05 Release does not include a Managed Identity Wallet (MIW) - aka the FOSS Wallet of Eclipse Tractus-X - as it was not - yet - able to cover functionalities required for the Self-Sovereign Identity Flow introduced with R24.05. To test and ship R24.05, a commercial solution was used: the Decentralized Identity Management (DIM) Wallet. To cover the wallet functionalities in the [E2E Adopter Journey Data exchange](#data-exchange) and [E2E Adopter Journey Portal](#portal), the [SSI DIM Wallet Stub](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/ssi-dim-wallet-stub) was added to the umbrella helm chart.
