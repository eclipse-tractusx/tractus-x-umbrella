## Bruno

There are Bruno collections containing all the data exchange flow between Alice and Bob:

- [Umbrella-bru](./Umbrella-bru) - Bruno collection in `.bru` format (recommended for Bruno CLI and latest Bruno versions)
- [Umbrella-json](./Umbrella-json) - Bruno collection in JSON format for compatibility

## Curl

There is a guide containing step by step tutorial on how to exchange data between [provider](../user/guides/data-exchange/provide-data.md) and [consumer](../user/guides/data-exchange/consume-data.md), using the console.
